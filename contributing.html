          <p>What do you <i>enjoy</i> working on? With most of the MoarVM team
          also being Perl 6 developers, we very much follow the -Ofun approach.
          For some of us, that's stress-testing various aspects of the VM (such
          as the GC), and reporting - or fixing - what comes up. For some,
          it's working on missing features. For some, it's profiling for hot
          spots and seeing what optimizations might apply. For some, it's doing
          the work to get MoarVM up and running on a platform it doesn't yet
          support. Find the itch you care to scratch, and join in!</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>So far, the community around MoarVM has been polite, professional,
          and light-hearted. A little patience, tolerance and forgiveness go a
          long way. Please help keep things pleasant.</p>
          <p>As for the practicalities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start out by sending pull requests or supplying patches. Commit
            bits are handed out to those who produce consistently good work.</li>
            <li>Please try to keep Git commits atomic, each doing an easily described
            (and thus easily reviewable) thing</li>
            <li>While forgiveness > permission typically applies, do communicate
            with others if unsure if a certain direction is the right way to go</li>
            <li>Technical debate is encouraged, but re-hashing existing design
            decisions over and over is not. MoarVM has a single architect, who
            has the final call. However, consensus is much preferred (and is
            almost always achieved so far :-).</li>
