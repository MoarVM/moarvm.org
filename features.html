        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>MoarVM provides very little directly - and that's a good thing.
          It is not tied to a particular way of doing inheritance, roles,
          mixins, method resolution, type-checking, and so forth. Instead,
          meta-objects written in a high level language implement the desired
          semantics.</p>
          <p>What MoarVM <i>does</i> provide is representations: ways of using
          and accessing memory. Meta-objects provide a description of the kind
          of representation that is needed, and MoarVM does the required work
          to compute structures, array storage, and so forth.</p>

          <h3 class="panel-title">Garbage Collection</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>MoarVM has a generational garbage collector. The young generation
          is managed by semi-space copying, making it cheap for objects to die
          young. The old generation is broken into sized buckets, with very
          large objects being specially handled. Since objects move over their
          lifetime, garbage collection is precise. When multiple threads are
          running, collection can run in parallel (meaning that the world is
          stopped, and multiple threads work on the collection job to get
          it done more swiftly). There is also support for finalizers.</p>
          <p>The GC has undergone stress-testing, including doing Rakudo
          builds with collection runs after every object allocation and
          using many memory-protected past fromspaces in order to catch a
          wide range of possible bugs. While of course this is not a proof
          that no bugs remain, it does mean they've been left little room
          to hide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Hot code is detected and optimized. On x64, much hot code can also be
            JIT-compiled into machine code. The optimizer specializes code by the
            number and types of incoming arguments. Since de-optimization is also
            available, speculative optimizations can be performed. Small routines
            called by hot code may be inlined, and hot loops are detected and
            replaced with an optimized version (known as On Stack Replacement).</p>

          <p>MoarVM includes the Unicode 15 database, and can do property
          lookups (such as those required in regular expression matching),
          character and sequence resolution by name, case change operations,
          comparisons using the Unicode Collation Algorithm, etc. Strings
          work at grapheme level. MoarVM strings are opaque, and there is
          no confusion between strings and bunches of bytes. It makes no
          sense to ask for a string's encoding; rather, a string can be
          turned into a bunch of bytes using an encoding.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>MoarVM has no official assembly language, and at present no
          known unofficial assembler. Provided a compiler is written using
          the NQP compiler toolchain (which NQP and Rakudo are), then
          code can be generated by producing a MAST data structure.</p>
